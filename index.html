  <p>This is a voluntary one dollar gift being sent out into The Universe with no strings attached. 
     It is not a raffle, purchase, or tax-deductible donation. No rewards or refunds will be provided. 
     The cosmos has a sense of humor: any good that follows is on you. The Universe is not responsible 
     for any positive effects set in motion, just the ripple that your gift creates.</p>
